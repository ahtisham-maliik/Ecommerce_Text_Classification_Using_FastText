# Ecommerce Text Classification Using FastText

![Ecommerce Text Classification Using FastText](cover__photo.png)

## Overview
This project implements a text classification system for e-commerce product descriptions using FastText. The model categorizes products into 4 distinct categories with 95.57% accuracy, demonstrating FastText's effectiveness for text classification tasks with minimal preprocessing.

## Dataset
- **Source**: `ecommerce_dataset.csv`
- **Initial Size**: 50,425 entries
- **Final Size**: 27,802 entries after cleaning
- **Features**:
  - `category`: Product category (4 classes)
  - `description`: Product description text

### Category Distribution
| Category                | Count  | Percentage |
|-------------------------|--------|------------|
| Household               | 10,564 | 38.0%      |
| Books                   | 6,256  | 22.5%      |
| Clothing & Accessories  | 5,674  | 20.4%      |
| Electronics             | 5,308  | 19.1%      |

## Data Preprocessing
### Cleaning Steps:
1. Removed 1 entry with missing description
2. Eliminated 22,622 duplicate entries
3. Normalized category names (e.g., "Clothing & Accessories" ‚Üí "Clothing_and_Accessories")

### Text Processing Techniques
- **Lemmatization**: Reduced words to their base/dictionary form (e.g., "paintings" ‚Üí "painting")
- **Lowercasing**: Converted all text to lowercase for consistency
- **Stopword removal**: Eliminated common words (e.g., "the", "is", "and")
- **Punctuation removal**: Removed special characters (e.g., commas, periods, quotes)

**Result**: Reduced average description length by ~30% (346 ‚Üí 243 characters)
